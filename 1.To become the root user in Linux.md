**To become the root user in Linux, you have a few options:**

**Using sudo:**

Most Linux distributions come with sudo configured by default for the user created during installation.
To switch to the root account temporarily, use the following command:
```
sudo -i
```
After providing your sudo password, you’ll be logged into the root account. You won’t need to use sudo for subsequent commands.

**Running Commands as Root:**

If you have sudo access and want to run specific commands as root, simply preface them with sudo. For example:
```
sudo whoami
```
This command will show that you’re running it as the root user.

**Logging in Directly as Root (Not Recommended):**

If your user doesn’t have sudo permissions, you can log in directly as root using the su command:
```
su -
```
You’ll need to know the root password.
Remember that logging in directly as root is discouraged due to security reasons. It’s safer to use sudo for administrative tasks.
